excerpt: 'We present a high-speed, three-dimensional shear wave imaging method for standard OCT systems that overcomes motion sensitivity and hardware limitations. Using pairs of B-scans and directional phase gradient analysis, our approach rapidly and robustly recovers shear wave fields. Validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms shows accuracy comparable to synchronous imaging and robustness across diverse wave conditions.'
