title: "Coronary Artery Flow Modeling in an Ex-vivo Biorobotic Heart"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'We developed an ex vivo biorobotic coronary artery flow simulator that replicates physiological coronary flow and myocardial motion in explanted porcine hearts. Using this platform, we induced coronary dissections, performed stent implantation, and evaluated interventions with intravascular OCT. This system enables precise testing of interventional strategies, improvement of PCI techniques, clinician training, and evaluation of novel coronary imaging and intervention devices.'
