I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in Medical Engineering & Medical Physics through the [Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/) program. I am broadly interested in medical imaging devices, optics, signal processing, and robotics.

My current research focuses on optical coherence tomography (OCT), elastography, and high-speed micromotor catheters for intravascular coronary artery imaging. I am advised by Professor NÃ©stor Uribe-Patarroyo and Professor Brett E. Bouma at the [Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation](https://octresearch.org/) within the [Wellman Center for Photomedicine](https://wellman.massgeneral.org/) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School.

Previously, I interned at [Auris Health](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aurishealth/) on the Advanced Development team for surgical robotics. After its [acquisition](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-to-acquire-auris-health-inc) by Johnson & Johnson, I returned in the following years to work with the same team in the Robotics and Digital Solutions group. My industry experience informs my research, providing practical insights into the design, development, and translation of medical devices.

I earned my undergraduate degree in general engineering from Harvey Mudd College through a unique, interdisciplinary curriculum designed to train us to solve complex, real-world problems. I also "dove" into research on autonomous underwater microgliders in the [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/).  

Outside the lab, I competed on BattleBots and was the [first woman](https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-women-historic-battlebots-runs-0208) to win the Giant Nut Trophy in Season 6 with our robot, [Tantrum](https://battlebots.fandom.com/wiki/Tantrum). All episodes are streaming on HBO Max.
