I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in Medical Engineering & Medical Physics through the [Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/) program. My research focuses on medical imaging devices, signal processing, and robotics, with a particular emphasis on optical coherence tomography (OCT), elastography, and high-speed micromotor catheters for intravascular coronary imaging. I am advised by NÃ©stor Uribe-Patarroyo and Brett E. Bouma at the [Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation](https://octresearch.org/) within the [Wellman Center for Photomedicine](https://wellman.massgeneral.org/) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School.

Previously, I interned at [Auris Health](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aurishealth/) on the Advanced Development team for surgical robotics. After its [acquisition](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-to-acquire-auris-health-inc) by Johnson & Johnson, I returned the following year to work with the same team in the Robotics and Digital Solutions group. My experience in industry greatly informs my research, providing me with practical insights into the design, development, and translation of medical devices.
