I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in Medical Engineering & Medical Physics through the [Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/) program. I am broadly interested in medical imaging devices, optics, signal processing, and robotics.

My current research focuses on optical coherence tomography (OCT), elastography, and high-speed micromotor catheters for intravascular coronary arterty imaging. I am advised by Professor NÃ©stor Uribe-Patarroyo and Professor Brett E. Bouma at the [Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation](https://octresearch.org/) within the [Wellman Center for Photomedicine](https://wellman.massgeneral.org/) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School.

Previously, I interned at [Auris Health](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aurishealth/) on the Advanced Development team for surgical robotics. After its [acquisition](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-to-acquire-auris-health-inc) by Johnson & Johnson, I returned in the following years to work with the same team in the Robotics and Digital Solutions group. My experience in industry greatly informs my research, providing me with practical insights into the design, development, and translation of medical devices.

I earned my undergraduate degree in general engineering from Harvey Mudd College though a unique and interdisciplinary curriculum designed to train us how to solve complex, real-world engineering problems. I also "dove" into research on autonomous underwater microgliders in the [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/).
